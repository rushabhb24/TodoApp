# TodoApp

To-Do App
A simple To-Do app developed as part of my learning journey in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me practice basic web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add tasks to a dynamic task list.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list once completed.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to work across different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content of the app.
CSS: For styling and ensuring the app is responsive.
JavaScript: For handling the logic of adding and deleting tasks.
How to Use
Open the index.html file in any web browser.

Add tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button. Once a task is completed, you can remove it by clicking the delete button next to it.

Learning Experience
This project was built as part of my self-learning phase while exploring front-end web development. It allowed me to grasp important concepts like:

DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
Styling with CSS.
Making web apps interactive using event listeners.
Basic UI/UX design for user-friendly interfaces.
Future Improvements
While this project is simple, I plan to add more features, such as:

Edit Tasks: Allowing users to modify tasks.
Task Filters: Adding functionality to filter tasks (e.g., completed, pending).
Local Storage: Saving tasks so they persist even after the browser is closed.
